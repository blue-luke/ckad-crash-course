Exercise 07
- Creating init containers. How did I finally get it to work? See exercise 8 - perhaps use of args instead of command was the issue?
- Writing a file to local file system using wget. STDOUT says it work but file doesn't exist. Why?

Ex 14
- Changing a service to a nodeport. Couldn't access it from outside the cluster though
